Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, 
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

nums = [2,5,6,7,8]
target = 7





def twosum(target, nums ): 

    

    n = len(nums)

    num_maps = {}

    for i, n enumerate num: 
        diff = target - nums[i]

        if diff in num_maps:
            return it 
        addd it 

    return []

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, 

typically using all the original letters exactly once.


Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

--> check whether they are the same word and if it = exists 

--> sort them first 

loop through both dictionaries,




def anagram(s, t): 

    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False 


    dictS, dictT = {}, {}

    sorted_s = s.sort  #aaagmnr

    sorted_t = t.sort

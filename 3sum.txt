we are to look for sets that contain, that do not equal each other and
return 0 

sort it an then take a first integer. For example '

sorted_numbers = [-3,-3,1,2,3,4]

takes the first integer num[0] check whether the next nummber and the former is the same and skip if its the same
l and r



num = [-3, 3, 4, -3, 1, 2]

fn = 0
l, r = fn+ 1, len(num) -1 


while l< r: 
    two_s = num[l] + num[r]
    fn = num[0]
    if num[fn] == num[fn+1]
        continue 
    elif ts> num:
